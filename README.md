# Everything is Fucked
This repository serves as a record of the discussion and any other outputs that arise from following the readings for [PSY 607: Everything is Fucked](https://hardsci.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/everything-is-fucked-the-syllabus/), by Sanjay Srivastava.

It will include a markdown version of the etherpad discussion each week, plus anything else that people put together and want to include in the repository.

If you are taking part and have something to contribute please do!
